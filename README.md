# **PCOS Clustering & Personalized Healthcare Recommendations**  

## 🌟 Project Overview  
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) affects millions of women worldwide, yet generic healthcare approaches fail to address their unique health needs. This project utilizes **Hierarchical Clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** to segment women based on health parameters, enabling **personalized healthcare recommendations**.  

## 📊 Features  
✅ **Data-Driven Segmentation**: Clustering based on real PCOS health indicators  
✅ **Advanced Clustering**: Uses **Hierarchical Clustering** & **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**  
✅ **Health Recommendations**: Personalized suggestions for improving women's health  
✅ **Data Visualization**: Insights through histograms, box plots, and dendrograms
